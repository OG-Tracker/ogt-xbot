Collators, responsible for block production and maintaining network health, often receive minimal rewards, reducing their incentive to perform effectively. The proposal suggests compensating collators to ensure efficient performance and network stability. Funding will cover operational costs for collators across three system parachains and provide staking rewards to permission-less collators. The proposal outlines a detailed budget breakdown and payment conditions, emphasizing fair compensation and incentivizing active participation in the Polkadot ecosystem.",

Subscan plays a vital role as a block explorer and analytics tool for the Polkadot network. The reimbursement will cover expenses including server infrastructure, security measures, and personnel costs. Server infrastructure costs are estimated to support the network's smooth operation. Security measures ensure user data safety, while personnel costs reflect the dedicated team needed to maintain Subscan's functionality. This support ensures Subscan's continuous operation and contributes to the growth and development of the Polkadot network.",

The proposed solution involves establishing a curator set to provide guidelines and oversee the development of key infrastructure and tooling with retroactive funding from the treasury upon successful delivery.",

The Web3 Foundation (W3F) previously covered these costs, but as marketing is now decentralized, the Treasury is being asked to fund the badges, which benefit the community and parachains. Currently, 36 accounts have badges, and this proposal will expand that to 47, including additional parachains and ecosystem wallets, with W3F continuing to pay for six specific accounts. The Verified Organization Badges offer numerous benefits such as priority visibility, impersonation defense, premium support, and more. The Social Media Editorial Board has set criteria for badge allocation to ensure effective management. Invoices will be sent to W3F, with compensation provided from the funds of this proposal.",

They are actively unstaking additional DOT through proxies, complicating recovery efforts. This proposal seeks to issue a whitelisted rebond call to restake the DOT, effectively extending the unstaking period by 28 days. This extension would provide Parallel Fi's team with critical time to explore solutions for regaining control of its parachain governance and addressing the security breach.",

      "summary": "This proposal aims to enhance Substrate's fast sync capabilities by addressing critical challenges in handling large chain states and improving reliability. Currently, Substrate’s state sync faces Out-of-Memory (OOM) issues when importing large states, and lacks persistent progress tracking, requiring restarts after interruptions. These limitations impact the usability of advanced sync strategies, including decentralized Bitcoin fast sync, as demonstrated in the Subcoin project funded by a previous Web3 Foundation grant. The proposed solution involves refactoring the state import logic to handle data more efficiently at the database layer and introducing mechanisms to resume interrupted sync processes. ",
